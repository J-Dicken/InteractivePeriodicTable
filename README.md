Html based Periodic table

One of the first html, css, js projects I made. Each element is hard coded in place which was a nightmare when things needed editing, but this was before I'd even heard of PHP.

If I were to create this again, I would use a JSON to store the element data and then use PHP to generate the HTML for each element rather than hard coding it.

Open index.html in a browser to view it

Clicking an element will change which one is displayed top centre, giving a more detailed overview of the element. This can then be clicked to link to that elements wiki page.
